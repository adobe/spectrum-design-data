# Spectrum Design Data MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI tools with structured access to Adobe Spectrum design system data, including design tokens and component API schemas.

## Overview

This MCP server enables AI assistants to query and interact with Spectrum design data through a standardized protocol. It provides access to:

* **Design Tokens**: Color palettes, typography, layout tokens, and semantic tokens
* **Component Schemas**: API definitions and validation schemas for Spectrum components
* **Future**: Component anatomy, design patterns, and guidelines

## Prerequisites

* **Node.js 20+**

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @adobe/spectrum-design-data-mcp
```

### Verifying Package Integrity

This package is published with npm provenance for enhanced supply-chain security. You can verify the package's attestations:

```bash
npm audit signatures
```

Or clone and run locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-design-data.git
cd spectrum-tokens/tools/spectrum-design-data-mcp
pnpm install
```

## Usage

### Starting the MCP Server

```bash
# Start the server (default command)
spectrum-design-data-mcp

# Or explicitly start
spectrum-design-data-mcp start
```

The server runs locally and communicates via stdio with MCP-compatible AI clients.

### Available Tools

#### Token Tools

* **`query-tokens`**: Search Spectrum tokens by name, type, or category
* **`query-tokens-by-value`**: Find tokens by direct or resolved value (follows aliases)
* **`get-token-details`**: Get detailed information about a specific token
* **`get-component-tokens`**: Get all tokens for a component name

#### Schema Tools

* **`list-components`**: List available components (no schema payload)
* **`get-component-schema`**: Full schema for one component
* **`validate-component-props`**: Validate props against schema
* **`search-components-by-feature`**: Find components by property name

#### Workflow Tools

* **`build-component-config`**: Generate a complete component configuration with recommended tokens and props
* **`suggest-component-improvements`**: Analyze existing component configuration and suggest improvements

## Agent Skills

Agent Skills are markdown guides that help AI agents use the Spectrum Design Data MCP tools effectively. They orchestrate multiple MCP tools into complete workflows for common design system tasks.

### Available Agent Skills

* **[Component Builder](agent-skills/component-builder.md)**: Guides agents through building Spectrum components correctly by discovering schemas, finding tokens, and validating configurations
* **[Token Finder](agent-skills/token-finder.md)**: Helps agents discover the right design tokens for colors, spacing, typography, and component styling

### How Agent Skills Work

Agent Skills are documentation files that:
- Guide AI agents through multi-step workflows
- Orchestrate existing MCP tools into complete tasks
- Provide examples and best practices
- Help agents discover the right tools for specific use cases

Unlike MCP tools (which are executable functions), Agent Skills are **guidance documents** that tell agents how to combine tools to accomplish complex tasks.

### Using Agent Skills

For AI agents working with Spectrum components:
1. Read the relevant Agent Skill when a user asks about a covered task
2. Follow the step-by-step workflow provided
3. Call the MCP tools as directed by the skill
4. Combine tool outputs into a complete solution

See the [Agent Skills README](agent-skills/README.md) for more details.

### Related Resources

This implementation follows the pattern established by [React Spectrum's AI integration](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/ai), which also uses MCP and Agent Skills to help AI agents work with design systems.

## Configuration

### MCP Setup

Add to your MCP configuration (e.g., `.cursor/mcp.json` for Cursor IDE):

#### Option 1: Using npx (Recommended)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "spectrum-design-data": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@adobe/spectrum-design-data-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 2: Using global installation

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "spectrum-design-data": {
      "command": "@adobe/spectrum-design-data-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option 3: Local development

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "spectrum-design-data": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "./path/to/spectrum-tokens/tools/spectrum-design-data-mcp/src/index.js"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: Using `npx` (Option 1) is recommended as it avoids PATH issues and ensures you always use the latest version. This approach mirrors other MCP servers like Browser MCP and resolves common NPX availability problems.

### Claude Desktop (Legacy Configuration)

For older Claude Desktop configurations:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "spectrum-design-data": {
      "command": "spectrum-design-data-mcp",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Other MCP Clients

The server uses stdio transport and follows the MCP specification. Refer to your client's documentation for configuration details.

## Examples

### Component Building Workflow

#### Component-Specific Token Discovery

```
Human: Show me all available button-related design tokens.

AI: I'll gather all button-related tokens from the Spectrum system.

[Uses get-component-tokens with componentName="button"]

Found button-related tokens across categories:
- Color tokens: floating-action-button colors
- Layout tokens: button sizing, padding, spacing
- Examples: radio-button-control-size-small, action-button-edge-to-hold-icon...
```

#### Finding Tokens by Value

```
Human: Which tokens resolve to 1px?

AI: I'll search for tokens whose value is 1px (direct or alias).

[Uses query-tokens-by-value with value="1px"]

Tokens with value 1px:
- border-width-100 (direct)
- picker-border-width (alias to border-width-100)
```

### Token Queries

#### Querying Color Tokens

```
Human: What blue color tokens are available in Spectrum?

AI: I'll search for blue color tokens in the Spectrum design system.

[Uses query-tokens tool with query="blue" and category="color"]

The Spectrum design system includes several blue color tokens:
- spectrum-blue-100: #e6f3ff
- spectrum-blue-200: #b3d9ff
- spectrum-blue-300: #80bfff
...
```

#### Validating Component Props

```
Human: Is this button configuration valid according to Spectrum?

AI: I'll validate those button properties against the Spectrum schema.

[Uses validate-component-props tool with component="action-button"]

The configuration is valid! All required properties are present and the types match the expected schema.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version  # Should be 20+

# Clear npm cache if needed
npm cache clean --force

# Verify package installation
npm list -g @adobe/spectrum-design-data-mcp
```

### MCP Connection Issues

1. Verify the MCP configuration file path
2. Check that Node.js path is correct
3. Ensure the package is installed globally or use npx
4. Restart your AI client after configuration changes

### Package Verification

```bash
# Verify package integrity
npm audit signatures

# Check for security vulnerabilities
npm audit
```

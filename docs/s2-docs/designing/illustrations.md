The illustrations and graphics in Spectrum 2 have been completely reworked to reflect the significant update of our design system.

Spectrum 2 (S2) evolved around the need to bridge the gap between purely professional tools and more consumer-orientated applications, creating updates that prioritize more approachability, a clearer sense of attention hierarchy, and a stronger connection to product branding. Illustrations are a major part of how Spectrum 2 creates such experiences.

Please note that parts of this illustration system are still in exploration, and will be added to these guidelines once they’re more defined. Animation is also currently being explored.

"Here’s a summary of the main updates that you’ll notice with Spectrum 2 illustrations, compared to the style of Spectrum 1:"

Linear illustrations are monochromatic. They use the same color token as the icons (S2 / gray 800), and switch colors according to dark and light UI.

"Linear illustrations use the following naming convention:"

Gradient illustrations are new to our design system with the update to Spectrum 2. Compared to linear illustrations, they’re much bolder. They can help users understand a message more quickly, or motivate them to perform a specific action.

There are two gradients that can be used for surfaces that show different products, or that are not product-specific. The other gradients are tied to specific products or clouds. For example, blue is tied to the photography and digital imaging category (such as Photoshop, Lightroom, and Fresco), while green represents the 3D category (such as Substance 3D Stager and Substance 3D Designer). It’s essential to use the appropriate illustration colors according to the product categories. If the application is for multiple products, use one of the gradient swatches that incorporate the Adobe brand red.

Do not use the category gradient sets as semantic colors to communicate meanings like errors (red), warnings (yellow), or successes (green).

"Gradient illustrations use the following naming convention:"

Linear illustrations are elements that communicate lower attention, as they blend in well with the rest of the UI. They can be used multiple times in a layout without drawing too much attention.

Errors or critical messages should only use linear illustrations.

Gradient illustrations use colors that can be misunderstood as semantic colors (e.g., green for positive, red for negative). They also have an upbeat and inspirational tone, which isn’t appropriate in situations where a user may be frustrated by something that’s an inconvenience or is disruptive to them in accomplishing their work.

The linear illustration style works well for layouts that feature a number of illustrations together (such as a collection of cards). Linear illustrations draw a lower level of attention and blend in well with the UI, so it’s appropriate to use them in a collection of elements. Gradient illustrations draw a lot of attention in multiples, so they need to be used sparingly and sparsely.

Don’t scale or resize linear illustrations. The stroke weight and the corner radii are already set to work best in the given canvas sizes.

Gradient illustrations are high attention elements in the layout. Use them strategically and thoughtfully to draw the user’s attention and to provoke a delightful moment.

Gradient illustrations draw more attention because they’re very colorful. Using more then one in a given view will make the UI too busy and too loud. Use gradient illustrations sparingly to guide a user’s attention to engaging, high-value actions such as uploads, starting projects, or commenting.

"Gradient illustrations incorporate product category colors, and also include colors that have semantic meanings in Spectrum: red, orange, or green. It creates inconsistency and confusion to have an error message or a critical alert in green (a color has a positive semantic meaning)."

Use gradient illustrations when you want to emphasize positive actions. Gradient illustrations have an upbeat and inspirational tone, which isn’t appropriate in situations where a user may be frustrated by something that’s an inconvenience or is disruptive to them in accomplishing their work.

The colors in gradient illustrations are connected to the product categories. For example, an illustration for a Substance 3D product should use the Substance 3D green colors.

Do not use different colors than those of your product category. Reach out to the Spectrum Brand team for guidance about the appropriate colors for your use case.

It’s highly recommended to test gradient illustrations as you’re designing your layout. They’re very expressive and colorful, so it’s important to determine how they complement (or don’t) different communication points (e.g., user-generated content, onboarding, feature banners, upsells, and more).

If gradient illustrations are making the layout too noisy, use linear illustrations instead.

Thematic banners are descriptive and represent a specific topic or feature. Similar to the gradient illustrations, they’re either connected to the product brand categories by color, or they use the generic gradient swatches.

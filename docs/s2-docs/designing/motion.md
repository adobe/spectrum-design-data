# Motion

**Motion in Spectrum 2 is still being developed. There's currently a dedicated working group of subject matter experts from across Adobe whose work will be added to these guidelines.**

## Overview

Spectrum 2 builds on top of the [existing motion guidelines for the design system](https://spectrum.corp.adobe.com/page/motion/): that motion is always purposeful, intuitive, and seamless. With this update, we also use motion to draw attention to areas where we want to add personality. No matter what, the usage of motion should be adding meaning to an experience. And, motion over large surface areas needs to support browser and system settings for reduced motion.

Motion is also an important part of brand expression. Just like tone in language, tone in motion can range from formal and direct to lighthearted and subtle.

Motion in Spectrum 2 is categorized into the areas of **directional** motion, **interaction** motion, and **wayfinding** motion. Wayfinding motion is still in development.

## Directional motion

The directions in which motion happens communicate intentional meanings. There are three basic categories of directional motion, each used for their own purpose.

### Linear

Linear motion indicates forward movement and a sentiment of progress. When emphasizing movement to a different section, page, or item (such as a button or link), the destination is readily clear and minimally disruptive.

If you're creating a custom animation, consider [RTL (right-to-left) languages](https://spectrum.corp.adobe.com/page/bi-directionality/) and also how the meaning of motion might differ depending on cultural context.

Progress bars communicate forward progression. They work well to show determinate (finite) progress.

In the example of a button, a static arrow icon facing toward the right already indicates forward movement. When linear motion is added to the arrow upon hover, the movement is emphasized. Use this button option with motion sparingly, only on the most important action(s) on a page.

### Diagonal

Diagonal motion indicates larger movement, and can be potentially disruptive. This type of motion can be used to emphasize that there's a switch in context happening, like linking out to a different view or destination.

In the example of a link, a static arrow icon facing the top right already indicates a potentially disruptive action. When diagonal motion is added to the arrow on hover, the meaning of the arrow is emphasized. Use this link option with motion sparingly, and only to communicate that there will be a switch in context.

### Clockwise

Clockwise motion indicates a holding pattern that's repetitive and doesn't have clear forward momentum or progress. This is most often used for loading indicators.

Progress circles have clockwise motion and work well to show indeterminate (infinite) progress.

## Interaction motion

Motion shows users feedback that, when interacting with the UI, their actions are registering with a system. It's not the only way to show feedback, but it helps objects to feel more dynamic and responsive. It also can help communicate meaning, or add emphasis that something is happening that requires attention.

A [microinteraction](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/microinteractions/) is a single action (like a click, tap, or swipe) which triggers a response (like a transition or animation). In Spectrum 2, microinteractions offer moments of personality that are reflective of product branding.

In this example, the button scales down on the down state, emphasizing that something — the action of selecting — happened.

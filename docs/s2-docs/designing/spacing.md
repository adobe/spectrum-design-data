# Spacing

## Overview

Spectrum 2 continues with Spectrum's current guidelines for spacing and responsive grids. More detailed guidelines for responsive design are currently in progress.

The primary update for Spectrum 2 is that **instead of dividers, spacing is used as the primary way to group and divide content**. Different spacing values establish rhythm and create hierarchy within a page. The [spacing values](https://spectrum.corp.adobe.com/page/spacing/#Spacing-values) themselves remain unchanged from Spectrum 1.

Smaller spacing values should generally be used for objects that are closely related. An example of this would be to use a smaller spacing value in between the components that make up a component group, like in a button group or a group of cards.

Larger spacing values should be used for groups of things that are less closely related. An example of this would be to use a larger spacing value to separate two distinct sections of content. Doing this helps to better organize a page.

In some contexts, a divider can still be appropriate to define larger areas of a page. View more about [border width](https://s2.spectrum.corp.adobe.com/page/object-styles/#border-width).

### Example

In this example, the side navigation items use a smaller spacing value (spacing-75) in order to show a closer relationship. The side navigation items are grouped with a combination of a section title and a larger spacing value (spacing-400) to divide two distinct sections.

Similarly, cards that are part of the same group have a smaller spacing value (spacing-300) between them. Each group of cards has a title and a larger spacing value (spacing-500) to show two that the two groups are distinct.

By using spacing intentionally, the purpose of page content becomes more readily apparent and information can become easier to parse.

## Density

Spectrum defines density as the spacing between components or UI elements, regardless of their size and scale. Density can be used alongside component size to create a range of layouts, from spacious to dense.

For example, when creating complex UI layouts, high density is often combined with smaller components and tighter spacing in between elements.

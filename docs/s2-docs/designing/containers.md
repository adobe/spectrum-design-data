Containers separate concepts with distinct purposes.

In Spectrum 2, containers have more defined rules to help guide in the creation of custom containers for product-specific contexts. Containers are used across Spectrum 2 interfaces in multiple ways, but the commonality they share is that they group related concepts together into distinct areas. Some usages of containers have more detailed guidelines.

For example, a card uses a container and inherits its properties, but it can only represent a distinct object (such as an individual asset or product). A block of marketing material containing multiple concepts (like subscription information plus actions to take) is grouped together in a container, but is not considered a card. Whether broad or specific, a user should be able to readily tell the purpose of a container.

"Examples of containers: two cards with different sizes and layout options, and a select box."

All containers share a set of defined styles.

Internal padding is dependent on component size, density, and platform scale, all of which vary for specific components and patterns.

This medium card uses spacing-300 for internal padding.

In this group of containers — each representing a product — different container styles can be used to draw attention to a specific item. In this case, the emphasized container is paired with a badge, and contrasts against the more subdued containers with filled (gray) backgrounds.

Note that specific components might have different options and states.

A consistent app frame helps create a sense of brand unity and helps users feel comfortable and familiar with our products. Predictable navigation is also especially helpful for users who work across multiple applications, and it makes it easier to learn how to use new products.

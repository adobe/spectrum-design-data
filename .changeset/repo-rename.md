chore: Update repository URLs from spectrum-tokens to spectrum-design-data

The repository has been renamed from `adobe/spectrum-tokens` to `adobe/spectrum-design-data` to better reflect its expanded scope beyond just tokens.

**Changes:**
- Updated all GitHub repository URLs (github.com/adobe/spectrum-tokens → spectrum-design-data)
- Updated all GitHub Pages URLs (opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-tokens → spectrum-design-data)
- Updated schema base URI to maintain consistency
- Git remote origin updated to new repository URL

**Note:** NPM package names remain unchanged. GitHub automatically redirects git operations from the old URL to the new one.

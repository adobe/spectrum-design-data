# Resources

## Resources

### Design

* **Figma**: S2 Web

## External links

The Spectrum 2 Figma libraries are the primary resource for Spectrum 2 components, styles, and variables. These libraries are stable, so you can use the designs in production.

"An example of the Spectrum 2 library: the action button page."

This GitHub repository houses Spectrum’s design tokens, which are primarily name-value pairs used to store design decisions and distributed in a way that platforms, implementations, and products can use across design tools and coding languages.

This tool allows you to search for token names or values, filter values by scale and theme, and explore the relationship between Spectrum’s tokens by selecting tokens to see their connections.

To support this transition, S2/Color has been removed from the inheritance chain in the Figma libraries. Designers should update their files to replace color styles with color variables. Following the steps in the guide will help ensure your files remain stable and aligned with the Spectrum system moving forward.

These changes are for Spectrum 2 libraries. They do not apply to Spectrum 1.

To support the new font, we’ve updated our default line-height values and introduced symmetrical vertical padding token values to our design system. The Spectrum 2 typography guide includes details about what’s changing, what’s staying the same, and options for updating design files or implementations.

These changes are for Spectrum 2 libraries and implementations. They do not apply to Spectrum 1 components.

Spectrum 2 includes two new grays — gray-25 and gray-1000 — plus an update to the rest of the 11 grays. The migration guide goes into more detail about what’s changing and what’s staying the same.

Creating interfaces that support right-to-left (RTL) and bi-directional (Bidi) languages is essential to ensuring that our products are inclusive of global audiences. These guides, created by the Adobe International team, offer comprehensive frameworks on how to design and build for both web and mobile components.

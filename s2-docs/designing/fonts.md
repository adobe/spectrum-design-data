# Fonts

Adobe Clean Spectrum is the default font family for Spectrum 2. This family contains both variable and static options. The variable font (VF) is the default typeface for Spectrum 2. Additional fonts are also used in the design system. Learn more about the difference between fonts on the [Typography](https://s2.spectrum.corp.adobe.com/page/typography-fundamentals/#overview) page.

## Spectrum fonts

For design, these fonts are pre-installed on Adobe's enterprise Figma account. For implementation, look for these in Adobe Fonts (formerly Typekit). If neither of those options support your use case, these fonts are available for download here. View [Using restricted Adobe fonts](#using-restricted-adobe-fonts) for more information.

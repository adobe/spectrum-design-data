# Principles

Spectrum 2 is a major update that expands the meaning of the design system's [core principles](https://spectrum.corp.adobe.com/page/principles/).

The foundational principles — **rational**, **human**, **focused** — have been updated to reflect the developments in how Spectrum has evolved and where it's going. We've also added a new principle — **collaborative** — to reflect how the design system has become something that's possible entirely because of the contributions and collaborations from all of Adobe.

We think of and use these principles in a few ways:

* The ideas on which Spectrum is built
* The considerations for building products at Adobe
* The criteria for validating decisions

These principles aren't just for visual or interaction design. We extend them to engineering, writing, strategy, and all of the ways that we build products at Adobe.

## Spectrum 2 principles

### Rational

Spectrum is based on real-world situations. Every component, pattern, and principle is informed by thoughtful testing. Every decision is backed by thorough interdisciplinary research.

Spectrum is not a rigid set of rules for how to build products, but rather a set of adaptable resources for making experiences feel contextual, cohesive, and performant.

### Human

Spectrum places people's needs first. It's deeply committed to a high standard of inclusivity, accessibility, honesty, and respect.

Spectrum is adaptable to meet as many user expectations, platform requirements, and product visions as possible. It's always what it needs to be, accommodating a flexible range of expression. It balances the human needs of utility and joy.

### Focused

Spectrum delivers what's needed, when it's needed. Every decoration is purposeful and meaningful. Every communication touchpoint is relevant.

Spectrum experiences are built to a high standard of quality. Everything incorporates attention to details, and that creates experiences that look and feel well-crafted. Things are delightful to use because they balance functionality and expression.

### Collaborative

Spectrum belongs to everyone. It's a reflection of an ever-growing community that makes decisions thoughtfully, holistically, and collectively.

Spectrum examines from multiple angles, then refines, then repeats. Constantly.
